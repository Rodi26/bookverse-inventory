BookVerse Inventory Service - Database Management Module

This module provides comprehensive database management functionality for the
BookVerse Inventory Service, including connection handling, table creation,
demo data loading, and session management with SQLAlchemy ORM.

üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview:
    The module implements a robust database layer with these components:
    - Engine Configuration: SQLite database with thread-safe settings
    - Session Management: Factory pattern for database session creation
    - Schema Management: Automatic table creation and migration support
    - Demo Data Loading: Comprehensive test data setup for development
    - Transaction Management: Proper commit/rollback handling

üöÄ Key Features:
    - Automatic database initialization and schema creation
    - Demo data loading with realistic book catalog and inventory
    - Session management with dependency injection pattern
    - Error handling with logging and transaction rollback
    - UUID-based primary keys for distributed system compatibility

üîß Database Configuration:
    - Engine: SQLite with connection pooling and thread safety
    - Sessions: Auto-commit disabled for explicit transaction control
    - Isolation: check_same_thread=False for FastAPI compatibility
    - Connection Management: Automatic cleanup with context managers

üìä Demo Data Features:
    - Realistic book catalog with metadata (titles, authors, genres)
    - Inventory records with stock levels and reorder points
    - Transaction history showing stock movements and adjustments
    - Price handling with Decimal precision for financial accuracy
    - Cover image URLs for frontend display

üõ†Ô∏è Development Usage:
    Database initialization:
    ```python
    # Initialize database (called during app startup)
    await initialize_database()

    # Use database session in FastAPI endpoints
    @app.get("/books")
    async def get_books(db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
        return db.query(Book).all()
    ```

    Manual session management:
    ```python
    # Direct session usage for scripts
    db = SessionLocal()
    try:
        books = db.query(Book).all()
        db.commit()
    finally:
        db.close()
    ```

üìã Dependencies:
    Core dependencies for database operations:
    - SQLAlchemy: ORM and database abstraction layer
    - SQLite: Embedded database for development and testing
    - Decimal: Precise decimal arithmetic for monetary values
    - UUID: Distributed system compatible identifiers
    - JSON: Demo data file parsing and handling

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:
    - Demo data is loaded only once (checks for existing records)
    - All transactions use proper commit/rollback for data consistency
    - UUID primary keys enable distributed system compatibility
    - Price fields use Decimal type for financial precision
    - Sessions must be properly closed to prevent connection leaks

üîó Related Modules:
    - models.py: SQLAlchemy model definitions and relationships
    - config.py: Database URL and configuration settings
    - services.py: Business logic layer using database sessions
    - main.py: Application initialization and database setup

üîí Security Considerations:
    - Connection strings should not contain credentials in production
    - SQLite is suitable for development but not production scale
    - Input validation prevents SQL injection through ORM usage
    - Transaction isolation prevents data corruption

üìä Performance Characteristics:
    - SQLite: Suitable for development and small-scale deployments
    - Connection pooling: Managed by SQLAlchemy for efficiency
    - Session lifecycle: Short-lived sessions for web request patterns
    - Demo data size: ~50 books with inventory for realistic testing

def create_tables():
    """
    Create all database tables defined in SQLAlchemy models.

    This function uses SQLAlchemy's metadata system to create all database
    tables based on the model definitions. It's safe to call multiple times
    as SQLAlchemy will only create tables that don't already exist.

    üéØ Purpose:
        - Initialize database schema from SQLAlchemy model definitions
        - Support both fresh database creation and incremental updates
        - Ensure all required tables exist before application startup
        - Provide logging for operational visibility

    üîÑ Table Creation Process:
        1. Collect metadata from all registered SQLAlchemy models
        2. Generate CREATE TABLE statements for missing tables
        3. Execute DDL statements against the database engine
        4. Verify successful creation with logging

    üìä Tables Created:
        - books: Product catalog with titles, authors, prices, and metadata
        - inventory_records: Stock levels, availability, and reorder points
        - stock_transactions: Transaction history for inventory changes
        - Additional tables: Based on model definitions in models.py

    üõ†Ô∏è Usage Examples:
        Application startup (typically called during initialization):
        ```python
        # Called automatically during database initialization
        await initialize_database()  # This calls create_tables internally
        ```

        Manual schema creation for testing:
        ```python
        # Create tables for test database
        create_tables()
        ```

        Schema updates during development:
        ```python
        # Safe to call when adding new models
        create_tables()  # Only creates missing tables
        ```

    ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:
        - Safe to call multiple times (idempotent operation)
        - Does not handle schema migrations for existing tables
        - Requires database write permissions
        - Should be called before any data operations

    üîß Configuration Dependencies:
        - DATABASE_URL: Must point to writable database location
        - Engine configuration: Thread safety and connection settings
        - Model definitions: All SQLAlchemy models must be imported

    üìã Error Handling:
        The function may raise these exceptions:
        - OperationalError: Database connection or permission issues
        - DatabaseError: SQL syntax or constraint violations
        - FileNotFoundError: SQLite database file creation issues

    üìä Performance Characteristics:
        - Execution time: < 1 second for SQLite database
        - Memory usage: Minimal (metadata processing only)
        - Network impact: None for SQLite, minimal for networked databases
        - Blocking operation: Synchronous execution

    üîó Related Functions:
        - initialize_database(): Complete database setup including data loading
        - load_demo_data(): Populate tables with sample data
        - Base.metadata: SQLAlchemy metadata registry

    üîí Security Considerations:
        - Requires database schema modification permissions
        - DDL operations cannot be rolled back in all database systems
        - Should not be exposed through API endpoints
        - Consider using database migrations for production

    Version: 1.0.0
    Thread Safety: Yes (SQLAlchemy handles concurrency)

def get_db():
    """
    Dependency injection function providing database sessions for FastAPI endpoints.

    This generator function creates and manages database sessions using the
    dependency injection pattern. It ensures proper session lifecycle management
    with automatic cleanup, making it safe for use in web request handlers.

    üéØ Purpose:
        - Provide database sessions to FastAPI route handlers
        - Ensure automatic session cleanup after request completion
        - Support dependency injection pattern for loose coupling
        - Handle session lifecycle management transparently

    üîÑ Session Lifecycle:
        1. Create new session from SessionLocal factory
        2. Yield session to the requesting function
        3. Function executes with database access
        4. Automatic cleanup in finally block (regardless of success/failure)
        5. Session closed and resources released

    üõ†Ô∏è Usage Examples:
        FastAPI endpoint with database dependency:
        ```python
        @app.get("/books")
        async def get_books(db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
            books = db.query(Book).all()
            return books
        ```

        Service layer dependency injection:
        ```python
        class BookService:
            def __init__(self, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
                self.db = db
        ```

        Transaction management in endpoints:
        ```python
        @app.post("/books")
        async def create_book(book_data: BookCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
            book = Book(**book_data.dict())
            db.add(book)
            db.commit()  # Explicit commit required
            return book
        ```

    Yields:
        Session: SQLAlchemy database session configured for the inventory database.
                 The session provides full ORM functionality including queries,
                 transactions, and relationship loading.

    ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:
        - Sessions are automatically closed after use (prevents connection leaks)
        - Transactions must be explicitly committed or rolled back
        - Each request gets a separate session instance
        - Session cleanup happens even if exceptions occur

    üîß Transaction Management:
        - Auto-commit is disabled (explicit commit required)
        - Rollback should be called on exceptions
        - Session state is isolated per request
        - Connection pooling managed by SQLAlchemy engine

    üìä Performance Characteristics:
        - Session creation: < 1ms overhead per request
        - Memory usage: Minimal per session (SQLAlchemy optimized)
        - Connection pooling: Reuses database connections efficiently
        - Thread safety: Each session is thread-local

    üîí Security Considerations:
        - Sessions are isolated between requests
        - No shared state between different users
        - Automatic cleanup prevents session hijacking
        - Connection string security handled at engine level

    üìã Error Handling:
        The function handles these scenarios:
        - Session creation failures (database connection issues)
        - Runtime exceptions (session automatically closed)
        - Normal completion (session closed in finally block)
        - Resource cleanup guaranteed regardless of execution path

    üîó Related Components:
        - SessionLocal: Session factory configured with database engine
        - FastAPI Depends: Dependency injection framework
        - SQLAlchemy Session: ORM session providing database access
        - Database engine: Connection pool and transaction management

    Example Integration Pattern:
        ```python
        # Typical usage in FastAPI application
        from fastapi import Depends
        from .database import get_db

        @app.get("/inventory/{book_id}")

        - Stock-out transactions (sales and shipments)
        - Adjustment transactions (corrections and audits)
        - Notes and metadata for audit purposes

    üîÑ Loading Process:
        1. Check if demo data already exists (idempotent operation)
        2. Load book catalog from JSON configuration file
        3. Create Book objects with UUID primary keys
        4. Load inventory data from separate JSON file
        5. Create InventoryRecord objects linked to books
        6. Generate sample transaction history
        7. Commit all changes in proper transaction boundaries

    üõ†Ô∏è Usage Examples:
        Automatic loading during initialization:
        ```python
        # Called during application startup
        await initialize_database()  # Includes load_demo_data()
        ```

        Manual demo data refresh:
        ```python
        # Reset demo data for testing

async def initialize_database():
    """
    Complete database initialization including schema and demo data.

    This is the primary function called during application startup to ensure
    the database is properly configured with schema and sample data for
    development and demonstration purposes.

    üéØ Purpose:
        - Ensure database schema exists and is up-to-date
        - Load demo data for development and testing
        - Provide single entry point for complete database setup
        - Support both fresh installations and updates

    üîÑ Initialization Sequence:
        1. Create all database tables from SQLAlchemy models
        2. Load comprehensive demo data (books, inventory, transactions)
        3. Log successful completion for operational visibility
        4. Handle any errors with proper logging and re-raising

    Usage:
        Application startup (called from main.py):
        ```python
        @asynccontextmanager
        async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
            await initialize_database()  # Complete database setup
            yield
        ```

        Manual database setup:
        ```python
        # Development environment setup
        await initialize_database()
        ```

    ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:
        - Async function for consistency with FastAPI patterns
        - Idempotent: Safe to call multiple times
        - Demo data loading is conditional (checks for existing data)
        - All operations are logged for debugging and monitoring
