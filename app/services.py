BookVerse Inventory Service - Business Logic Layer

This module implements the core business logic services for the BookVerse Inventory Service,
providing a clean separation between API controllers and data access layers. The service
classes encapsulate all business rules, validation logic, and complex operations for
book catalog management, inventory tracking, and transaction processing.

The service layer serves as the primary business logic orchestrator, implementing:
- Complex business rules and validation logic
- Multi-table operations with proper transaction management
- Data transformation and aggregation for API responses
- Audit logging and business event tracking
- Integration points with external services and systems

Architecture Pattern:
    This module follows the Service Layer architectural pattern, providing:
    - Clean separation of concerns between API and data layers
    - Reusable business logic that can be consumed by multiple interfaces
    - Centralized transaction management and error handling
    - Consistent data validation and business rule enforcement
    - Clear integration points for testing and mocking

Service Classes:
    - BookService: Comprehensive book catalog management and operations
    - InventoryService: Real-time inventory tracking and stock management
    - TransactionService: Transaction history and audit trail management

Key Features:
    🔒 **Transaction Safety**: All operations use proper database transactions
    📋 **Business Rules**: Comprehensive validation and business logic enforcement
    📊 **Data Aggregation**: Complex queries with joined data and calculated fields
    🔍 **Audit Logging**: Complete operation tracking for compliance and debugging
    ⚡ **Performance**: Optimized queries with minimal database round trips
    🔄 **Integration**: Clean interfaces for external service integration

Usage Patterns:
    ```python
    # Book management through service layer
    with db.session() as session:
        book = BookService.create_book(session, book_data)
        inventory = InventoryService.adjust_inventory(session, book.id, adjustment)
        transactions = TransactionService.get_transactions(session, book.id)
    
    # Service methods handle all business logic internally
    books_with_availability = BookService.get_books_with_availability(
        db=session, skip=0, limit=20
    )
    ```

Dependencies:
    - SQLAlchemy: Database ORM for data persistence
    - Pydantic: Data validation through schema models
    - UUID: Unique identifier generation and handling
    - Logging: Comprehensive operation and error logging

        maintaining data integrity across all business operations.
        
        This method implements sophisticated update patterns including partial
        field updates, automatic timestamp management, and comprehensive
        logging to provide reliable book modification capabilities for
        administrative and automated content management systems.
        
        Business Logic:
            - Validates book existence before modification
            - Supports partial updates through exclude_unset pattern
            - Maintains automatic timestamp tracking for audit purposes
            - Preserves data integrity through validation
            - Implements optimistic update patterns

            - Preserves all historical data and relationships
            - Maintains referential integrity with orders and transactions
            - Updates timestamp for audit trail tracking
            - Provides boolean success indicator for operation verification
            - Comprehensive logging for deletion audit trail
        
        Soft Deletion Benefits:
            - Preserves order history and transaction records
