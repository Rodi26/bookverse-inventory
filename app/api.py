BookVerse Inventory Service - API Router Module

This module implements the comprehensive FastAPI router for the BookVerse Inventory Service,
providing a complete RESTful API interface for book catalog management, inventory tracking,
and transaction processing within the BookVerse microservices architecture.

The API router serves as the primary interface layer, handling HTTP requests and responses
while orchestrating business logic through service classes. It implements enterprise-grade
features including authentication, authorization, comprehensive error handling, request/response
validation, and detailed logging for observability.

Key Features:
    üìö **Book Catalog Management**: Complete CRUD operations for book entities
    üì¶ **Inventory Tracking**: Real-time inventory levels and availability management
    üìä **Transaction Processing**: Detailed audit trail for all inventory adjustments
    üîí **Authentication & Authorization**: JWT-based security with role-based access
    üìã **Request Validation**: Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
    üîç **Health Monitoring**: Deep health checks with dependency verification
    üìÑ **Pagination Support**: Efficient large dataset handling with metadata
    üö® **Error Handling**: Structured error responses with detailed context
    üìä **Logging & Observability**: Comprehensive request/response logging

Architecture Integration:
    - Integrates with BookVerse Core utilities for common functionality
    - Utilizes dependency injection for database sessions and authentication
    - Implements standardized response formats across the platform
    - Provides health check endpoints for container orchestration
    - Supports distributed tracing and monitoring integration

API Endpoints Structure:
    - Health & Status: /health, /auth/status, /auth/test, /auth/me
    - Book Management: /api/v1/books (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
    - Inventory Operations: /api/v1/inventory (GET), /api/v1/inventory/adjust (POST)
    - Transaction History: /api/v1/transactions (GET)

Request Flow:
    1. Request receives initial validation and logging
    2. Authentication/authorization middleware processes security
    3. Database session injected via dependency injection
    4. Business logic executed through service layer
    5. Response formatted using standardized response models
    6. Comprehensive error handling with detailed context
    7. Request completion logged with performance metrics

Error Handling Strategy:
    - HTTP 400: Client errors (validation, bad requests)
    - HTTP 401: Authentication failures
    - HTTP 403: Authorization/permission failures
    - HTTP 404: Resource not found
    - HTTP 500: Internal server errors with sanitized details
    - Structured error responses with correlation IDs

Security Implementation:
    - JWT token validation for protected endpoints
    - Role-based access control (RBAC) for administrative operations
    - Input sanitization and validation to prevent injection attacks
    - Audit logging for all inventory modification operations
    - Rate limiting and request throttling capabilities

Performance Considerations:
    - Efficient pagination for large result sets
    - Database query optimization through service layer
    - Response caching headers for appropriate endpoints
    - Asynchronous request processing where beneficial
    - Connection pooling for database operations

Usage Examples:
    ```python
    # Import the router in your FastAPI application
    from .api import router as inventory_router
    
    app = FastAPI()
    app.include_router(inventory_router, prefix="/inventory")
    
    # Health check usage
    response = requests.get("/inventory/health")
    # Returns comprehensive health status
    
    # Book listing with pagination
    response = requests.get("/inventory/api/v1/books?page=1&per_page=20")
    # Returns paginated book list with metadata
    
    # Inventory adjustment (requires authentication)
    headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer <jwt_token>"}
    data = {"quantity_change": 10, "reason": "restock", "reference": "PO-123"}
    response = requests.post("/inventory/api/v1/inventory/adjust?book_id=<uuid>", 
                           json=data, headers=headers)
    ```

Development Notes:
    - All endpoints include comprehensive request/response logging
    - Database transactions are handled at the service layer
    - Authentication is handled through dependency injection
    - Validation errors include detailed field-level feedback
    - All endpoints support distributed tracing headers

Monitoring & Observability:
    - Request duration and response size metrics
    - Error rate tracking by endpoint and error type
    - Authentication success/failure rates
    - Database query performance tracking
    - Business metric tracking (books created, inventory adjustments)

Dependencies:
    - FastAPI: Web framework for API implementation
    - SQLAlchemy: Database ORM for data access
    - Pydantic: Data validation and serialization
    - BookVerse Core: Shared utilities and standardized components
    - UUID: Unique identifier handling for resources
